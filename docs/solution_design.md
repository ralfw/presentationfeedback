# Solution Design
For each (smallest) increment identified during requirements analysis a flow design and class design is done.

# Persistence in General
Persistence of data will be achieved by using an EventStore (ES).

# coapp/upload (command)
Uploading a conference stores the data provided in a CSV file in the ES. Events are:

* **ConferenceRegistered**, context: conference id, payload: conference title
* **SessionRegistered**, context: session id, payload: session title, starting time (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS), ending time (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS), speaker name, speaker email address
* **SessionAssigned**, context: conf. id, payload: session id

Signature of interaction function:

	int RegisterConference(string id, string title, string csvSessions)

The return value is the number of sessions registered.

The _csvSession_ param contains the contents of the CSV file uploaded. Getting the data from the file (possibly a stream) is the responsibility of the _Head_.

## Flow Design
The process can initially look like this:

![image](images/design/inc01.png)

No checks for existence of conference and/or sessions. If the same conference gets uploaded several times it will be added several times. No harm done to already given feedback.

This behavior can be used to upload conferences in multiple chunks.

No deletion of sessions possible this way.

## Class Design
For now storing of conference and sessions can be done by the same class. Let's call it _Repository_.

Parsing the sessions will be done by a _CSVParser_. It does not need to be specific. No need to introduce domain data types yet.

Integration is the responsibility of the _Body_.

## Library Design
_Repository_, _CSVParser_, and _Body_ can go into the _coapp.body_ library.

The _Head_ should be separated into _coapp.head.console_ which can be started from the console.

# afapp/session overview (query)
Display the list of sessions of a conference. Active sessions are those where feedback can be given currently.

Signature of the interaction function:

	SessionOverviewVM GenerateSessionOverview(string confId)
	
	struct SessionOverviewVM {
	  string ConfId;
	  string ConferenceTitle;
	  SessionVM[] ActiveSessions;
	  SessionVM[] InactiveSessions;
	}
	
	struct SessionVM {
		string Id;
		string Title;
		DateTime Start, End;
		string SpeakerName;
	}

The session overview is generated from events recorded during upload.

The *VM suffix denotes a ViewModel data structure, i.e. a data structures whose sole purpose is to carry information to be displayed. It's not a "stable" domain data structure.

## Flow Design
1. Assemble a conference aggregate
	1. Get the conference title from _ConferenceRegistered_ events.
	2. Get all sessions from _SessionRegistered_ events.
	3. Get the conference sessions from _SessionAssigned_ events.
	4. Weed out irrelevant sessions.
2. Split sessions into active and inactive
3. Build ViewModel

## Class Design
Assembling the _ConferenceData_ aggregate is a matter of a _Repository_ I suppose. Separating active and inactive sessions, though, is domain logic. But it's none pertaining to structural consistency; so it does not belong to the aggregate, which is a data structure. Rather it should go into a domain class of its own, e.g. _Conference_.

Building the ViewModel is a task for a _Mapper_.

## Library Design
Again I'd split the classes across two assemblies: _afapp.body_ and _afapp.head.console_.

# afapp/give feedback (command)
Registering the feedback of an anttendee creates the following event:

* **FeedbackGiven**: context: session id, payload: conference id, email, score, comment.

Signature of the interaction function:

	void Store_feedback(FeedbackData data);

	class FeedbackData {
	{
		public string SessionId;
		public string Email;
		public TrafficLightScore Score;
		public string Comment;
	}

	enum TrafficLightScore
	{
		Red = 0,
		Yellow = 1,
		Green = 2
	}

The Store\_feedback method returns void. According to the requirements the user should be redirected back to the conference after submitting the feedback. Since FeedbackData contains the conference id the calling method knows this value already so there is no reason to return it.  

## Flow Design
The flow design for this interaction seems to be quite simple. 

1. Store feedback.

## Class Design
Storing of the feeback is the resposibility of the Repository class.

## Library Design
"Give feedback" is part of the afapp so again we use the _afapp.body_ and _afapp.head.console_.
